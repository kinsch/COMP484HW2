How are structural tags like aside, article, nav, and section being used?
The aside tag is being used within the section tag to show that it is within
a section of its own and tangentially related to its content. The article tag is
being used to group the content that relates to each other. The nav is used to
represent a section of the page that links to other pages also within the site.
The section is used to group elements that would be explicitly listed in the
document's outline.
